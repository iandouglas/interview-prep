# Intended Audience

This book primarily targets early-career web development job seekers. Ideally,
the reader has just finished learning software development, either through a 
professional academic channel, or self-taught, and is seeking help to draft a 
proper resume and cover letter for the North American job market, and preparing
to study.

The challenge in writing this book is to understand the thinking and mindset of
both the candidate and the interviewer. I try to cover both angles in each 
section, such as how to properly format a resume but also how a resume is
typically screened by a hiring manager. How should you prepare a cover letter,
and how that letter may be analyzed by its reader.

I offer tips on what to study and prepare for coding puzzles during an 
interview as a candidate, and why those topics are important to companies.
