# About the Author

My journey into technology started with the sale of the Commodore 64 in 
the summer of 1982. I taught myself BASIC as an 8-year old kid, and the 
passion to write code has never quietened. I pursued Electrical Engineering 
in college and lasted a year, but it made me realize that software was a 
viable career option. I switched my major to Computer Engineering, 
graduated in three years, and I've been a professional software developer 
since the spring of 1996.

Almost half of my career has been spent finding the best candidates for 
positions my employers had open, through evaluating resumes, phone screens 
and conducting on-site interviews. I've also spent significant time 
refining on-site interview processes, and several years as a hiring manager 
or director of engineering and negotiating with candidates to find what's 
going to make everyone happy.

While a lot of my background comes from working in companies from 4 
employees to 300 employees, I've also worked at much larger firms with 
employees in the thousands.

This open-source book is a summary of a group class that I conduct, usually 
on Monday nights, to discuss common preparation areas for being on the 
"candidate" side of a technical interview. I usually share most of this 
content in about 90 minutes, but I've added a lot more notes to this written 
version both for students who have attended in the past, students who are 
unable to attend due to the day/time I conduct the class, and for students 
to whom a spoken class is otherwise inaccessible to them in some way.

These notes come from my many years as a hiring manager, but also as a 
candidate to serve as an example of how to conduct yourself before, during 
and after an interview, and to provide some insight into what I perceive 
as trends in our industry.

Throughout my career, I've had opportunity to look over several thousand 
resumes and identify quality candidates. Over that time, I've learned what 
works well for presenting what you know and how to get yourself noticed 
when human eyes fall on your resume.

This document will present lots of do's and don'ts when it comes to 
building a technical resume and a cover letter for a job application.

This entire book, come to think of it, is full of my own opinions and 
observations over the years, you should seek out as much advice as possible 
when making an important decision like applying for a new job.

I've held one or more of the following roles at various jobs for more than 
half of my career as a software developer and engineering manager within 
companies ranging from dozens of employees to thousands:

- Screening resumes and applications
- Planning company interview strategies
- Working on appropriate technical screening questions and in-person 
  screening questions
- Creation of and grading on-site software development by candidates
- Conducting or facilitating phone screenings, on-site and remote technical 
  interviews, and panel discussions to review candidates
- Making Hire/No-Hire decisions on candidates
- Public speaking on technical hiring and interview preparation

While I haven't studied psychology in a formal setting, I believe that 
there are lessons we can all learn about how our minds think, how we 
perceive answers, and how we can determine outcomes within technical 
interview settings.

The notes contained in this book are my ideas, some drawn from inspiration
and credit is given wherever possible, around what I consider to be 
technical interview best practices for both candidates and employers, as 
well as offering a glimpse into what we could all do (mostly on the 
employer side) to change the perception of awful technical interviews and 
doing things differently. We all want a candidate that stands out among the 
rest, why not do the same for your company's reputation as an innovative 
interviewing experience?

A goal I heard at a former employer was to develop such a stress-free 
interview process that we could execute in such a way where telling a 
candidate they weren't going to be hired would still cause them to walk 
away thinking the interview was an amazing experience. He coined the phrase,
"Candidate Experience".

Don't let my voice be the only one you listen to on the subject of 
preparing for, or conducting, a technical interview. Just as a plant needs 
more than just water to, it also needs sunshine and nutrients, growth can 
only happen through several channels of nourishment.
