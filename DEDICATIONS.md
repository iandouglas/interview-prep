# Dedications

This is by far the easiest part of the book to write.

I couldn't manage my day to day life without my superhero wife, 
Elizabeth. She's put up with mood swings, endured hundreds and 
hundreds of hours of me doing mock interviews and chatting with 
people eating into evenings and weekends. As verbose as I am in 
this book, there aren't enough adequate words to express my love 
and gratitude. Smoochie.

To my boys: you guys make me so proud of you on a regular basis. 
I love watching you grow and learn, and I especially love being 
your dad. I never would have thought you'd follow in my footsteps 
with such a love for music and technology. Always chase after 
good things in life and never be afraid to try something new.

To Jeff Casimir, and the staff and students of the Turing School 
of Software & Design: thank you so much for allowing me the freedom 
to share this knowledge with you all since late 2014 in the 
capacity of a volunteer mentor. So many of you have touched my 
life in positive ways and I'm so happy to watch your success. I'll 
collectively refer to all of you as “Turing” in the book.

To Ken. The journey is never complete, but I'm getting "better". RIP.
